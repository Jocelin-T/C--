/* #################################### std::list ####################################
* Notes:    std::list is a doubly-linked list, the elements are not one after the others
             in the memory (like array or vector), but the element is link with a pointer,
             who point to the next and previous elements.
            It's better to use it when the container size is constantly modified.
